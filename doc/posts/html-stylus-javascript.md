# HTML5-Stylus-JavaScript — Gulp build

> Gulp 4 is used

## Getting started

`gulp` - the basic command that runs the build for development using browser-sync

`gulp build` - the command for the production build of the project. All assets are compressed and optimized for hosting.

`gulp cache` - the command that should be run after `gulp build` if you need to upload new files to the hosting without caching.

## Folder and file structure

```

## npm-scripts

You can call gulp scripts via npm.
It is also possible to validate html in the assembly.

`npm run html` - launches the html validator, you need to run it if there are html files in the **public** folder.

## Working with html

Thanks to the **gulp-file-include** plugin, you can split an html file into various templates that should be stored in the **partials** folder. It is convenient to divide an html page into sections.

> To insert html parts into the main file, use `@include('partials/filename.html')`

If you want to create a multi - page website, copy **index.html**, rename as you need, and use.

When using the `gulp build` command, you will get a minified html code in one line for all html files.

## Working with CSS

The assembly uses the **stylus** preprocessor.

Styles written in **components** should be included in **main.styl**.
Styles from **\fonts**, **\vars** and **\mixins** are connected in **global.styl**.

To connect third-party css files (libraries) - put them in the **vendor** folder and connect them in the file **vendor.styl**.

If you want to create your own mixin, do it in the **mixins** folder, and then connect it to the **\mixins.styl** file.

If you want to use scss variables, connect **\vars.styl** also to main.styl or to any other place where it is needed, but be sure to remove **:root**.

> To connect css files, use the `@import`directive

Three files are created in the resulting folder **public/css**: <br> **main.css** - for page styles, <br> **global.css** - for global styles, <br> **vendor.css** - for styles of all libraries used in the project.

When using the `gulp build` command, you will get a minified css code in one line for all css files.

## Работа с JavaScript

Support for `import` and `require` is not implemented! Files are collected automatically from various folders.

It is better to divide the JS code into components - small js files that contain their own implementation isolated from each other. Place such files in the **components** folder.

In the file **main.js** does not connect anything, it is recommended for implementing the general logic of the site.

To connect third-party js files (libraries), put them in the **vendor** folder.

When using the `gulp build` command, you will get a minified js code in one line for all js files.

## Working with fonts

The build supports only the **woff2** format.

Upload the **woff2** files to the **resources/fonts** folder, and then call the `@font-face` mixin in the **\_fonts.scss** file.

## Working with images

Put any images other than **favicon** in the **img** folder.

If you need to make an svg sprite, put the svg files needed for the sprite in the **img/svg** folder. Just leave other svg files in the **img** folder.

When using the `gulp build` command, you will get minified images in the final folder **img**.

## Working with other resources

Any resources (assets) of the project that do not have a corresponding folder assigned to them should be stored in the **resources** folder. These can be video files, php files, favicon, and others.
